<h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I started my career in the Australian Public Service where I predominantly worked in 
        L&D roles. I have held an Assistant Director role at both IP Australia and APVMA 
        (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority). 
        I am currently the Learning and Development (L&D) Manager of MPS. Within my 
        vetting career, I have also worked as a Vetting Analyst (PV) and Quality Assurance
        officer (PV). I also previously managed and delivered the Certificate IV in Personnel 
        Security within my role as MPS RTO Manager.
